# PHP Encore
Base structure for API skeleton.

I developed this structure to use on my own projects. It provides you

* Dependency inject container
* JSON presentation layer
* Routing
* API authentication for SPA projects
* Database setup
* Logging interface
* CORS-enabled middleware


These are must-to-have standard features for an API backend project. 

Please use [skeleton](https://github.com/octophp/skeleton) to start your project. 

I also added a React based [SPA project](https://github.com/octophp/frontend) to show authentication system.
